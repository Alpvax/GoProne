# GoProne
[Download from Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/goprone/files)

Minecraft mod to allow players to manually go prone and crawl through 1-block-spaces. Uses the 1.14+ vanilla mechanic.

Just adds a keybind (default "C") which sets the player to the crawling pose, allowing them to sneak through 1-block high gaps, without needing to squash something on top of them.

Version 1.1.0 onwards also adds a second keybind (not bound to anything by default) which allows you to toggle being prone.

Requires [Minecraft Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net). Not required on the client (Although clients without it will not be able to go prone).


You may use this mod in modpacks without asking permission.
