# GoProne
Port of [GoProne](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/goprone) ([GitHub](https://github.com/Alpvax/GoProne)) by Alpvax to Fabric.

Minecraft mod to allow players to manually go prone and crawl through 1-block-spaces. Uses the 1.14+ vanilla mechanic.

Just adds a keybind (default "C") which sets the player to the crawling pose, allowing them to sneak through 1-block high gaps, without needing to squash something on top of them.

Also adds a second keybind (not bound to anything by default) which allows you to toggle being prone.

Requires [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)

You may use this mod in modpacks without asking permission.

## Changes from Forge version
Server config can be found in `config/goprone.json` and uses JSON instead of TOML.

This version in not compatible with Forge (i.e. you can't play on Forge servers with GoProne Forge from Fabric client with GoProne Fabric)
